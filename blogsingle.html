            <h2>Hospital Nursing Care: Some Observations</h2>
            <p>
              Pehabilitation medicine is one of the best-kept secrets in
              healthcare. Although the specialty is as old as America’s Civil
              War, few people are familiar with its history and purpose. Born
              out of compassion for wounded soldiers in desperate need of
              societal re-entry and meaningful employment, “physical
              reconstruction” programs were developed to provide everything from
              adaptive equipment to family training, labor alternatives and
              psychological support for veterans.Physical medicine and
              rehabilitation (PM&R) then expanded to meet the needs of those
              injured in World Wars I & II, followed closely by children
              disabled <a href="#">by the polio epidemic.</a>In time, people
              recognized that a broad swath of diseases and traumatic injuries
              required focused medical and physical therapy to achieve optimal
              long term function.
            </p>
            <u>
              Today, cancer patients frequently benefit from comprehensive
              rehabilitation as they recover from the effects of chemo
              (neuropathy, weakness, and cognitive impairments), radiation
              (scarring and range of motion limitations), surgery (flaps,
              plastics procedures, tumor resection, amputations), and brain
              injuries.

            <p>
              Rehabilitation is a phase of recovery occurring after any major
              life-changing medical or surgical event. Our bodies are designed
              to regenerate and repair, though optimizing this process takes
              skilled guidance. PM&R physicians (also known as physiatrists) are
              trained to use physical modalities (stretching, strengthening,
              heat, cold, etc.) to mechanically enhance healing. They prescribe
              medications to manage pain, spasticity, nerve injury, and
              cognitive impairments, while also leveraging the power of physical
              therapy to increase cardiopulmonary fitness, muscle strength and
              flexibility.

              Inpatient rehab’s prime directive is to get patients back home. To
              succeed at home, patients need to be able to function as
              independently as possible, using trained assistants for managing
              the activities<span> that cannot be performed without help.</span>
              Admission to a rehab hospital or unit offers the patient home
              practice opportunities – with simulated challenges that can
              include everything from terrain parks, test kitchens, medication
              management trials.

              In other cases when care is palliative, learning new skills and
              being fitted with battery or electric-powered equipment can mean
              the difference between living at home or in an assisted
              environment. Some successful cancer patients come to inpatient
              rehab to practice managing their activities of daily living with
              varied amounts of assistance, preparing for increased needs as
              time goes on so they can enjoy being at home for as long as
              possible.

              There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation,
              hard work, and learning from failure.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              For the physiatrist, cancer is a cause of impairments that can be
              overcome with creativity and practice, no matter the long-term
              prognosis. Adaptive equipment, physical exercise, and cognitive
              retraining may be applied intensively (3 hours a day in the
              inpatient setting), or at a slower outpatient pace, depending on
              individual need.
